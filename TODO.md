# To Do List

* Make the UI not hideous
* Switch to non-legacy input controls
* Add "table" mode queries which only have value fields and no timestamp or labels
* More test datasets and queries
* Add "debounce" to query editor so query doesn't fire on every keystroke
* Support query variables
* Support optional variables
